# Advent of Code 2023
These are my solutions for the 2023 "Advent of Code"-Event.

After compiling, start the program with a day and task number.
```
AoC23 <DayNumber> <TaskNumber> [Input file name suffix]
```
The program executes the correspondiung function and executes it using the input file at `DayXX/day_XX_input.txt` (where XX is the day number).
